Commission Junction Publisher Service Agreement

Introduction

This Publisher Service Agreement ("Agreement") is made by and agreed to between Commission Junction, Inc., a Delaware corporation, located at 530 East Montecito Street, Santa Barbara, CA 93103, USA ("CJ"), and you ("You"). As an application service provider, CJ facilitates "Performance Marketing Programs" by providing services ("Network Service") via the Internet. A "Performance Marketing Program" ("Program") is where a person, entity, affiliate or its agent, operating "Web site(s)" (internet domain, or a portion of a domain) and/or other promotional methods to drive traffic to another's Web site or Web site content ("Publisher") may earn financial compensation ("Payouts") for "Transactions" (actions by Visitors as defined by the Advertiser) referred by such Publisher via an action made by a "Visitor" (any person or entity that is not the Publisher or the Publisher's agent) through an Internet connection ("Link") to a Web site or Web site content operated by another person or entity ("Advertiser") from an Advertiser authorized promotional method used by such Publisher. The Advertiser compensates the Publisher, in accordance with this Agreement and the Program Payout specifications.

1. Participation in Programs.
(a) Acceptance by Advertiser. During this Agreement You may apply to Advertiser Programs for the opportunity to earn Payouts by promoting Advertisers in accordance with the Advertiser's Program terms and complying with this Agreement. Upon approval by the Advertiser for acceptance into its Program, You may display (and remove) Links to Advertiser's Web site or Web site content in accordance with the Advertiser's Program terms and this Agreement. An Advertiser's acceptance of You extends only to the entity, or individual, that enters into this Agreement with CJ.
(b) Program Terms. The details of an Advertiser's Program shall be available through the Network Service. Transactions qualifying for a Payout are defined by the Advertiser. Advertisers may change any Payout rate upon no less than 7 days written notice through the Network Service with effect from the 8th day (or such later date as specified by Advertiser).
(c) Additional Terms. Publishers and Advertisers may enter into direct contractual relationships through the apply to join process in the form of a click-through agreement hosted by CJ (“Click-through Agreement”) or in the form of an offer made to You by Advertiser via the members' area on the Network Service (“Offer”). It is Your obligation to review and accept or decline a Click-through Agreement or Offer when such is presented to You. If accepted by You, compliance with the Click-through Agreement or Offer is solely Your responsibility. The terms and conditions of the Click-through Agreement or Offer may supersede or conflict with this Agreement and shall apply only with respect to Your relationship with that particular Advertiser.
(d) Prohibited Uses of Links.

    (i) Locations. You may not place Links to an Advertiser's Web site or Web site content in third party newsgroups, message boards, blogs, unsolicited email and other types of spam, link farms, counters, chatrooms, or guestbooks. Publishers using IRC channels, instant messages or similar Internet resources must designate their program as special requiring manual review and acceptance by the Advertiser.
    (ii) Non-Bona Fide Transactions. You must promote Advertisers such that You do not mislead the Visitor, and such that the Links deliver bona fide Transactions by the Visitor to Advertiser from the Link. You shall not cause any Transactions to be made that are not in good faith, including, but not limited to, using any device, program, robot, Iframes, or hidden frames. You may or may not be compensated for Transactions where You or Your agent are the Visitor. Multiple Leads from the same individual, entity or IP address may be considered non-bona fide Transactions. You shall not earn Payouts for non-bona fide Transactions.
    (iii) Infringement. None of Your promotional activities may infringe an Advertiser's proprietary rights (including but not limited to trademark rights), CJ's proprietary rights, or a third party's proprietary rights.

(e) Updating Links. If Links to Advertiser are not dynamically updated through the Network Service, upon notification You are obligated to update an Advertiser's Links in order to earn Payouts.

2. Publisher Obligations to CJ.
(a) Accurate, Up-to-Date Information. You agree to provide CJ and Advertiser with accurate information about You and Your promotional methods, and to maintain up-to-date “Account” information (such as contact information, Web sites used, etc.). In Your Account, You must accurately, clearly and completely describe all promotional methods by selecting the appropriate descriptions and providing additional information when necessary. Some promotional methods will be designated by the system as “special”. Special programs are linked to promotional methods and practices considered unique and require manual approval and acceptance by the Advertiser. CJ reserves the right to define any program as special.
(b) Use of Links. You represent and warrant that all promotional means used by You will not contain objectionable content (including but not limited to content that is misleading, libelous, defamatory, obscene, violent, bigoted, hate-oriented, illegal, and/or promoting illegal goods, services or activities), and that You will not mislead others. You agree to: (i) use ethical and legal business practices, (ii) comply with the Advertisers' Program terms and this Agreement, (iii) maintain a privacy policy on Your Web site and for any non-Web site based promotional method made available to Visitors, and (iv) designate Your Publisher Account as “special” if You promote an Advertiser(s) by any means other than displaying a Link to the Advertiser on Your Web site. CJ must approve all of Your promotional activities and may deem Your promotional activities inappropriate and a material breach of this Agreement in CJ's sole discretion. Our network quality department reviews publisher conduct and any suspected fraudulent, abusive or otherwise illegal content or activity by You through Your promotional methods, or that is perpetrated through use of the Network Service, is grounds for immediate termination of this Agreement or deactivation of Your Account.
(c) Promotional Methods. You represent and warrant that You will not engage in and/or facilitate spamming, indiscriminate advertising or unsolicited commercial email or otherwise fail to comply with the CAN SPAM Act of 2003 (Public Law 108-187 or any successor legislation), and/or any other laws and/ or regulations that govern email marketing and/or communications. You represent and warrant that You will not engage in pop-up or pop-under advertising using any means involving third party properties and/or services (software). Pop up/unders are acceptable on a first party basis only when triggered by Your site content /site visit or by downloadable software applications for which You are the owner/operator. Pop up/unders delivered through downloadable software cannot engage in means that force clicks or perform redirects, or pop over a pay-per-click listing or natural search results. Pop up/unders must honor the CJ Publisher Code of Conduct requirements (as such requirements may be modified from time to time), including but not limited to: (i) installation requirements, (ii) enduser agreement requirements, (iii) afsrc=1 requirements, (iv) requirements prohibiting usurpation of a Transaction that might otherwise result in a Payout to another Publisher (e.g. by purposefully detecting and forcing a subsequent click-through on a link of the same Advertiser) and (v) non-interference with competing advertiser/ publisher referrals.
(d) Personally Identifiable Information of Visitors. You represent and warrant that You will not enable the Tracking Code to collect personally identifiable information of Visitors that would allow CJ to personally identify Visitors.
(e) Privacy. You must conspicuously post Your privacy policy on Your Web site and otherwise make it available to all Visitors. Your privacy policy must comply with all laws and regulations regarding the privacy of Visitor information, be commercially reasonable, and fully and accurately disclose Your collection and use of Visitor information. You must fully and accurately disclose Your use of third party technology, including CJ's tracking technology, use of cookies and options for discontinuing use of such cookies.
(f) Applicable Codes and Code Maintenance. In order for CJ to record the tracking of Visitors' Transactions resulting from clicks on Links to Advertisers promoted by You, You must include and maintain a CJ “Tracking Code” within the Advertiser's Links. All Advertiser Links and all advertisements ("Ad Content") must be in a Network Service compatible format.
(g) Usage and Security of Account. You shall be responsible for all usage and activity on Your account and for loss, theft or unauthorized disclosure of Your password (other than through CJ's negligent or willful conduct or omission). You shall provide CJ with prompt written notification of any known or suspected unauthorized use of Your Account or breach of the security of Your Account.

3. CJ's Services.
(a) Tracking Transactions and Payouts. CJ shall determine (where possible) actual Payouts that should be credited to Your Account. CJ may, in CJ's sole discretion, apply an estimated amount of Payouts, if: (i) You are referring Visitors to Advertiser as verified by clicks through Links to Advertiser with CJ Tracking Code, (ii) where there is an error in Advertiser's transmission of Tracking Code data to CJ, and (iii) where CJ is able to utilize a historical analysis of Your promotion of Advertiser to determine an equitable amount of estimated Payouts.
(b) Charge-backs. An Advertiser may apply, or CJ may apply, a debit to Your Account in an amount equal to a Payout previously credited to Your Account in circumstances of : (i) product returns; (ii) duplicate entry or other clear error; (iii) non-bona fide Transactions; (iv) non-receipt of payment from, or refund of payment to, the Visitor by the Advertiser; or (v) Publisher failure to comply with Advertiser's Program terms or other agreement with Advertiser ("Charge-back"). Charge-backs may be applied to Your Account at any time, including previous payment cycles.
(c) Access to Tracking and Reporting Tools. CJ shall provide You with access to tracking and reporting tools, and to support services. From time to time CJ may offer optional services for a fee. Fees for such optional services are at CJ's then-current published rates or as may be quoted by CJ, and are payable in advance or may be off-set against Your positive Account balance (at CJ's discretion). Tracking detail regarding Visitor Transactions is not available on a real-time basis for all Advertisers and there may be reporting delays regarding Transactions for some Advertisers. CJ may make available, for fees that CJ shall publish from time-to-time, enhanced reporting capabilities and other services that are not included in the standard Network Service.
(d) Support. Support for your program is available on-line through the "Contact Us" area in the CJ Account Manager, which allows You to categorize and describe Your issue. Online help also allows You to check the status of all issues through the "Check Question Status" feature. Phone support may also be available during operating hours, except holidays.
(e) Facilitating Payment of Payouts. Subject to other provisions in this Agreement, CJ shall credit Your Account with a Payout for each qualifying Transaction in accordance with the Advertiser's Payout rate and Program terms for the relevant Transaction. On the 20th day of each calendar month, CJ will issue to You any positive balance in Your Account for Transactions reported for the previous month, provided Your Account balance exceeds the required “Minimum Account Balance.” CJ shall have no obligation to make payment of any Payouts for which CJ has not received payment from the relevant Advertiser of all monies due to CJ (including for all Payouts owed by such Advertiser to all of such Advertiser's Publishers). If CJ elects, in its own discretion, not to make payment to You for amounts not received from an Advertiser, those amounts shall not be included in the Minimum Balance Amount. Your recourse for any earned Payouts not paid to You shall be to make a claim against the relevant Advertiser(s), and CJ disclaims any and all liability for such payment. You may elect to receive payment in any of the currencies that CJ supports (as may be amended by CJ). The conversion rate shall be determined in accordance with CJ's operating standards using the rates prevailing upon the date that payment is made to You, or upon the basis of historical conversion rates if rates are unavailable. The number or amount of Transactions, credits for Payouts, and debits for Charge-backs, as calculated by CJ, shall be final and binding on You.
(f) Dormant Accounts. If Publisher's Account has not been credited with a valid, compensable Transaction that has not been Charged-back during any rolling, six consecutive calendar month period (“Dormant Account”), a dormant account fee at CJ's then-current rate shall be applied to Publisher's Account each calendar month that Publisher's Account remains an open yet Dormant Account or until Your Account balance reaches a zero balance, at which time the Account shall become deactivated. Transactions will not be counted if the Transaction subsequently becomes a Charge-back.
(g) Negative Accounts. You may have a negative balance if Your Account is debited amounts equivalent to previous Payouts for Charge-backs and You do not have an adequate Account balance to cover the Charge-back amounts. When You have a negative balance, You must immediately remit payment to CJ in an amount sufficient to bring Your Account to a zero balance, or Your Account is subject to 1.5% interest per month, compounded monthly.

4. Proprietary Rights.
(a) Linking to Advertisers. For each Advertiser's Program that You have been accepted to, the Advertiser is granting to You the right to display and Link to the Advertiser's Web site or Web site content in accordance with the Advertiser's Program terms for the limited purposes of Promoting the Advertiser's Program, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Your use of the Link signifies Your agreement to refrain from copying or modifying any icons, buttons, banners, graphics files or content contained in the Link, including but not limited to refraining from removing or altering any copyright or trademark notices. As between CJ and Publisher, CJ owns all rights in and to all information regarding the Visitors that You refer to Advertisers through CJ.
(b) CJ's Use of Your Marks. You authorize CJ to utilize Your trademarks, service marks, tradenames, and/or copyrighted material that You provide to CJ through Your Account to promote Your participation in the Network Services.
