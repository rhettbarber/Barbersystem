c = cipher is just caller the cipher method defined above, which just  
does Open::Cipher::Cipher.new("aes-256-cbc"), i.e. give me a new  
cipher object that does 256bit AES in CBC mode. c.encrypt says that  
you want to encrypt and the iv is the initialization vector. You can  
read up on that if you want, essentially it's just one of the  
parameters for the encryption
