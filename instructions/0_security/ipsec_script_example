# IPSec Configurations to Lock Down a New Server
#
# WHAT IS THE POINT?
# Well, good security practices dictate keeping servers off the network until they have been
# fully patched, which is rarely achievable from system CDs. Thus, before a server is conn-
# ected to the network, we use IPSec to restrict traffic such that no host may initiate an
# incoming connection, and only the local Windows Software Update Server may be contacted.
#
# HOW TO RUN THIS SCRIPT
# netsh -f newServerLockdown.txt
#
# THEN WHAT?
# Once the server is fully patched, hotfixed, and service packed, these IPSec rules may be
# blown away with two commands, or so it is believed by the author:
# netsh ipsec dynamic delete all
# netsh ipsec static delete all

############# Set IPSec mode to dynamic ############

pushd ipsec dynamic

# Dump packet drops to the Event Log
set config property=ipsecdiagnostics value=7

# Allow as few exemptions as possible
set config property=ipsecexempt value=3

# During boot sequence, allow only stateful connections initiated by the server
set config property=bootmode value=stateful

popd

############ Set IPSec mode back to dynamic ############

pushd ipsec static
set store location=local

# Clean the slate and remember these settings
# DO NOT DO THIS IF YOU DO NOT WANT YOUR STATIC CONFIGS ZAPPED!
