--On the mirror server instance on BS_MIRROR, set the server instance on BS_PRIMARY as the partner (making it the initial --principal server instance). 
--Substitute a valid network address for TCP://BS_PRIMARY.Mydomain.Corp.barbersystem.com:7024. 
--For more information, see Specifying a Server Network Address (Database Mirroring).
	 
--At BS_MIRROR, set server instance on BS_PRIMARY as partner (principal server):
ALTER DATABASE BARBERSYSTEM_WORKING 
    SET PARTNER = 'TCP://BS_PRIMARY.s250913283.onlinehome.us:7024';
GO
 

--On the principal server instance on BS_PRIMARY, set the server instance on BS_MIRROR as the partner (making it the initial mirror server instance). Substitute a valid network address for TCP://BS_MIRROR.Mydomain.Corp.Adventure-Works.com:7024. 
 
--At BS_PRIMARY, set server instance on BS_MIRROR as partner (mirror server).
ALTER DATABASE BARBERSYSTEM_WORKING

--This example assumes that the session will be running in high-performance mode. To configure this session for high-performance mode, on the principal server instance (on BS_PRIMARY), set transaction safety to OFF.
--Change to high-performance mode by turning off transacton safety.
--ALTER DATABASE BARBERSYSTEM_WORKING 
--    SET PARTNER SAFETY OFF
--GO
 
--Note:  
--If you intend to run in high-safety mode with automatic failover, leave transaction safety set to FULL (the default setting) and add the witness as soon as possible after executing the second SET PARTNER 'partner_server' statement. 
--note that the witness must first be configured for outbound and inbound connections.
